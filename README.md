Description :

1-At first I created two calsses the first class named String data & second class is String character 

2- Class named "String character" contian the main function & has the required  text to extract data from

3- Secondly , Class name "String data"contain the following :  

a-has one attribute which job to store a copy of text & privtate to make sure text not being maulplated by any other  classes or method out side this class 

b- one setter to pass the required text to private attribute 

c- Three getter one for getting white space, getting vowels , getting length of the strings "I will discuss every point right now "

4-Getter method named "Get_Number_Of_WhiteSpaces()", it has return intger value which reperesents number of white spaces its concept is extracting each character seperated from the string &
check if it is white space or not , if so the counter named "sapce" will be incremented.

5-Getter method named "Get_String_Length() ", it has return intger value which reperesents number of length of string without counting white space  its concept is getting all caharacters to lower case then extracting each character seperated from the string & check if it is character or not using if the ascii number between 'a' & 'z', if so the counter named "str_len" will be incremented.

6-Getter method named "Get_Number_Of_Vowels()  ", it has return intger value which reperesents number of vowels in the string    its concept is is getting all caharacters to lower to make sure only cheking vowels in lower case only then extracting each character seperated from the string & check if it is vowel character or not by checking on vowels character , if so the counter named "vowel_count" will be incremented. 

We can get also consonants by String length  - String vowels
